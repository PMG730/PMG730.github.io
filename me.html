        <p>My fascination with computers began with a pivotal experience: building a computer from scratch with a close friend. This hands-on endeavor not only demystified the intricate hardware and software components but also sparked a deep-seated love for technology's inner workings. This newfound passion led to a natural progression towards web development, a field that seamlessly blends creativity with technical expertise.</p>
        <p>A significant influence on this career path was my brother-in-law, a respected manager at Webflow. His insights and encouragement played a pivotal role in nurturing my burgeoning interest in web technologies. Inspired by his guidance and fueled by my own curiosity, I embarked on a journey to explore the vast and ever-evolving world of web development.</p>
        <p>Transitioning from a personal passion to a professional pursuit, I secured a role at my church's data department. Here, I found a meaningful way to contribute to my community by enhancing the digital infrastructure. I then have learned form my boss and co workers how to become even better at what I love to do.</p>
   <p>I am now finishing my freshman year at OTC as a cis student. My hope  it to one day be able to work from home to be with my family and work on websites.</p>
